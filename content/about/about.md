I am a PhD researcher at [COSIC KU Leuven](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/cosic/) under supervision of Ingrid Verbauwhede. My professional skills broadly cover cryptography, computer architecture, embedded systems, and digital integrated circuit design.

My PhD research focuses on the _implementational challenges of lattice-based cryptography_. I have worked extensively on side-channel attacks and countermeasures for post-quantum cryptosystems, and on hardware acceleration of fully homomorphic encryption. As a part of my PhD, I completed internships at Microsoft Research and Rambus.

In my free time, I love to travel and be outdoors. You will often find me on my mountain bike, kitesurfing, or on a hike or ski tour in the Alps.

## Interests

- Fully-Homomorphic Encryption
- Post-Quantum Cryptography
- Computer Architecture
- Hardware Security

## Teaching

During my first three PhD years, I was a TA of the [EAGLE](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/onderwijs/bachelor-master/bachelor/eagle) project where students build an autonomous, secure quadcopter. I have also supervised 9 master thesis students and 7 internship students.
